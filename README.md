# 🌊🐠 TheFriendsAndDemosWeMadeAlongTheWay
*"Fish are friends. Not food."* – Some wise fish, probably 🐟✨

Welcome, traveler of code!  
This repo is basically the scrapbook of side quests, late-night coding sprints, and projects that somehow survived the caffeine storms. Think of it as a mixtape of demos, experiments, and “wow, that actually worked” moments.

## 🎮 Featured Friends (Repos You’ll Want to Pet)
- 🐛 [CatchBugsWithMax](https://github.com/Manaiakalani/CatchBugsWithMax)  
   Because debugging is just extreme bug catching. Ash Ketchum would be proud.  

- 🕹️ [RetroPongGame](https://github.com/Manaiakalani/RetroPongGame)  
   Pong, but make it fashion. Minimalist. Retro chic. Guaranteed to trigger nostalgia.  

- 🔥 [EverythingIsFine](https://github.com/Manaiakalani/EverythingIsFine)  
   For when the code compiles, but your soul doesn’t. Inspired by that one dog meme we all know and love.  

- 📑 [PDFTableExtractor](https://github.com/Manaiakalani/PDFTableExtractor)  
   Because sometimes you just want the table. Not the whole PDF. Just the table. (No shade to PDFs, but… 🙃)
